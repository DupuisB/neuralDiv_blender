# Neural Subdivision for Blender

---

**A full presentation of the project can be found in the [report](report.pdf).**

---

This repository contains a Blender extension that implements the research paper **["Neural Subdivision"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01819)**, allowing for data-driven, stylized 3D mesh refinement directly within the viewport.

Instead of traditional, linear subdivision rules, this tool uses a neural network to learn non-linear rules from example meshes. This allows for the creation of unique, "stylized" geometry that can capture the essence of a training dataset.

**Note that this repository is not production-ready and is intended for educational purposes. Some features may be limited or missing.**

## ðŸ’¡ Core Features

*   **Apply Neural Subdivision:** Refine any selected mesh using a pre-trained neural network.
*   **Stylized Results:** Choose from different models trained on distinct datasets (e.g., humanoid, organic, chaotic) to achieve unique stylistic effects.
*   **Simple UI:** Integrated directly into Blender's sidebar (`N` Panel) and accessible via a hotkey (`Shift + N`).

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage

1.  **Download:** Download the repo as a `.zip` file or clone it.
    *   Note that this repository **does not** contain the pre-trained models due to their size.
2.  **Install in Blender:**
    *   Go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...`
    *   Select the downloaded `.zip` file.
    *   Enable the "Neural Subdivision" add-on.
3.  **Usage:**
    *   Select a mesh object in your scene.
    *   Open the sidebar with the `N` key and find the "Neural SubD" tab.
    *   Alternatively, use the `Shift + N` hotkey.
    *   Choose a pre-trained model from the dropdown.
    *   Click **Apply Neural Subdivision**.
